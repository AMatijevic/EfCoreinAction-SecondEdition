# EfCoreInAction SecondEdition - part1 (master branch)

Welcome to the Git repo that is associated with the first six chapters in the book Entity Framework Core in Action (second edition). This book details how to use Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to develop database access code in .NET 5 applications.

Other braches are:

* Part2, which covers part 2 of the book - chapters 7 to 11.
* Part3, which covers part 3 of the book - chapters 12 to 17.

## What you need to install

To run any of the code you need to.

1. Install a development tool, either **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**. If you are new to .NET Core development, then I recommend Visual Studio - here is a link on [how to install Visual Studio](http://mng.bz/2x0T), but see chapter 1, section 1.6.1 for more information.
2. Clone this repo to your local computer. See Visual Studio tutorial called [Open a project from a repo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/tutorial-open-project-from-repo).


## How to use this branch

I have placed all the code relating to part 1 of the book, which covers the first six chapters. The main projects you can run are:

* `MyFirstEfCoreApp`, which is the console application found in chapter 1
* `BookApp`, which is the ASP.NET Core application that I cover in chapters 2 to 6.

Once you have installed your chosen development tool, then you can run either of these applications - both are designed to create and seed any database that they use.

If you are having problems with the application then please post an issue on the [EfCoreInAction-SecondEdition issues page](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCoreinAction-SecondEdition/issues), with the stack trace or compile error and I will have a look and get back to you.
